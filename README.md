## Challenges

```python
A) Project Structure: I designed a developer friendly structure and put all the code on right place.
B) Manage State: I used redux and makes it easy to manage the state globaly and i also used the class state management also.
C) Independent Components: I designed independent components so that these can be reusable.
D) Manual Testing: I verified the application manually and with console as well.
foobar.singularize('phenomena') # returns 'phenomenon'
```
## Improvement
